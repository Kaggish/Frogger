# Frogger

# About
This is a first-year project that I am remaking,
this project was one of the first projects I made during my studies at Uppsala University in Game design and programming

This is a Frogger copy made in C++ with raylib, it was originally based on a library that our teacher created (Galba), however it was limiting and I wanted to see how I have developed my skills now that I have graduated.

# TODO
Make the game work again

# Future Ideas
Highscore with saving locally
Background music
